        <h4>About Me</h4>
    
        <p>I am a 25 year old college student trying to change my career path. For over ten years, I have been working in the culinary arts as a level 3 cook in fine dining. I learned many new skills
            with my last employer who was a Red Sealed Chef. It was one of the hardest jobs I had, and decided to change my career path towards something new. In the year of 2013, I won the merits of a canadian poet my poem is called "The Sweet Nectar", in 
            loving memory of my beloved nana. After achieving this honour, I was granted the english award of excellence at Newmarket High School because of my poem. In June of 2024, I achieved an honour certificate, and I won the "Academic Award of Excellence" for achieving the highest grade point average in the General Arts and Science
            Technology Program. I was offered a chance at a scholarship because of this award in 2024, but I ended up dropping out of Humber College because the program I was taking was too complex for me. Now, I am back in the saddle, and currently loving the Computer Programming and Analysis program, and hoping I havee found my second career.
